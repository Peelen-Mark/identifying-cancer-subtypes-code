# identifying-cancer-subtypes-code

The code in this repository is used to gather the results for the paper "Cancer Subtype Identification through Integrating Inter- and Intra-Dataset Relationships in Multi-Omics Data". The code heavily relies on the MDICC method, which can be referenced as:

"Yang, Y., Tian, S., Qiu, Y., Zhao, P., & Zou, Q. (2022). MDICC: Novel method for multi-omics data integration and cancer subtype identification. Briefings in Bioinformatics, 23(3), bbac132."

To execute this code, it is necessary to download the code from the aforementioned paper, as it provides the functions used in the "code_modification_fusion.R" file. Additionally, the data utilized in this study was obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Specifically, I worked with the following ten cancer types:

- BRCA
- KIRC
- LUAD
- LIHC
- GBM
- LUSC
- SARC
- OV
- AML
- SKCM
